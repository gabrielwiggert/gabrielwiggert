Hey there!

I'm Gabriel Wiggert and I'm a Fullstack Developer / Software Engineer. I've studied in a Fullstack Web Development bootcamp by Driven Education.
I have a bachelor's degree in Business from Mackenzie Presbyterian University and I'm a former Computer Engineering student from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). There, I was a member of the university's group of studies in robotics, getting to play with micro controlers such as Arduino and various electronic components - two of the main projects I worked in there were the development of a self guiding drone (in which I was the test pilot before the automation process started :P) and the making of some cool IoT devices/applications. I also participated in the 2016's Global Game Jam at the university's Institute of Computing, developing a full video game in 48h.

The main programming languages I use are JS/TS, CSS, HTML and C. The main technologies I use are React.js for front-end development and Node.js for building back-ends.
I have experience building servers and APIs with Express and layered architecture and working with SQL databases such as Redis and Postgres (purely or along with Prisma ORM), as well as no-SQLs such as MongoDB. I'm also skilled at testing software with Jest/Supertest/Cypress (manual, unit, integration and e2e testing), DevOps principles and CI/CD practices, working with Docker, AWS, GitHub Actions and deploys on Heroku/Vercel.

Fun fact: I'm a music and video producer in my free time! Even got to make some soundtracks/sound FX for video games.
