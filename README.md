Hello!

I'm Gabriel Wiggert and I'm currently enrolled in a Fullstack Web Development bootcamp by Driven Education.
I have a bachelor's degree in Business from Mackenzie Presbyterian University and I'm a former Computer Engineering student from the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP). There, I was a member of the university's group of studies in robotics, getting to play with micro controlers such as Arduino and various electronic components - two of the main projects I worked in there were the development of a self guiding drone (in which I was the test pilot before the automation process started :P) and the making of some cool IoT devices/applications. I also participated in the 2016's Global Game Jam at the university's Institute of Computing, developing a full video game in 48h.

The main programming languages I use are JS and C. The main technologies I use are React for front-end development and Node.js for back-end.

Fun fact: I'm a music and video producer in my free time! Even got to make some soundtracks/sound FX for video games.
